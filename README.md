### How to export my model?

A full example can be seen [here](https://github.com/mari-linhares/mnist-android-tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow_model/convnet.py)

1. Train your model
2. Keep an in memory copy of eveything your model learned (like biases and weights)
   Example: `_w = sess.eval(w)`, where w was learned from training.
3. Rewrite your model changing the variables for constants with value = in memory copy of learned variables.
   Example: `w_save = tf.constant(_w)`  

   Also make sure to put names in the input and output of the model, this will be needed for the model later.
   Example:  
   `x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 1000], name='input')`  
   `y = tf.nn.softmax(tf.matmul(x, w_save) + b_save), name='output')`  
4. Export your model with:  
   `tf.train.write_graph(<graph>, <path for the exported model>, <name of the model>.pb, as_text=False)`

### How to run my model with Android?

You need `tensorflow.aar`, which can be downloaded from [the nightly build artifact of TensorFlow CI](http://ci.tensorflow.org/view/Nightly/job/nightly-android/), here we use [the #124 build](http://ci.tensorflow.org/view/Nightly/job/nightly-android/124/artifact/).

### Interacting with TensorFlow

To interact with TensorFlow you will need an instance of TensorFlowInferenceInterface, you can see more details about it [here](https://github.com/mari-linhares/mnist-android-tensorflow/blob/master/MnistAndroid/app/src/main/java/mariannelinhares/mnistandroid/Classifier.java)
